### Image and Video processing project

## Project overview

This project implements various image and video processing techniques using C++ and CUDA. The focus is on applying these techniques to either multiple small pieces of data (e.g., arrays representing signals over time) or a few large pieces of data (e.g., images and videos). The goal is to demonstrate the application of these processing techniques in a way that is efficient and scalable, leveraging the power of parallel computation provided by CUDA.

## Compilation and execution

### Prerequisites

- CMake
- CUDA Toolkit
- OpenCV

### Compilation

To compile the project, navigate to the root directory of the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This will generate the necessary binaries in the `build/` directory.

### Execution

You can run the compiled project using the following command:

```bash
./my_opencv_project
```

This will execute the main program, which applies several image processing techniques to `lena.jpg` and stores the results in the `Results/` directory.

## Processing techniques and algorithms

### 1. **Gaussian Blur**
   - **Description**: A Gaussian blur is applied to the image, which smoothens the image by reducing noise and detail. It is implemented using a convolution with a Gaussian kernel.
   - **Output**: `blurred_image.jpg`

### 2. **Canny Edge Detection**
   - **Description**: Canny edge detection is a multi-stage algorithm that detects a wide range of edges in images. It is known for its accuracy in edge detection and noise reduction.
   - **Output**: `canny_edges.jpg`

### 3. **Sobel Edge Detection**
   - **Description**: Sobel operators are used to detect edges by calculating the gradient of the image intensity. This method highlights regions of high spatial frequency, which correspond to edges.
   - **Output**: `edge_detection.jpg`

### 4. **Color Space Conversion (BGR to HSV)**
   - **Description**: Converts the image from the BGR color space to HSV. This is useful in various image processing tasks where color information is crucial.
   - **Output**: `hsv_image.jpg`

### 5. **Negative Image**
   - **Description**: Creates a negative of the image by inverting the color values. This technique is often used in photographic film processing.
   - **Output**: `inverted_colors.jpg`

### 6. **Grayscale Conversion**
   - **Description**: Converts the image from color to grayscale, which reduces the complexity of image processing tasks by removing color information.
   - **Output**: `grayscale_image.jpg`

### 7. **Image Resizing**
   - **Description**: The image is resized to half of its original dimensions, demonstrating basic geometric transformations.
   - **Output**: `resized_image.jpg`

## Lessons learned

- **Parallel processing with CUDA**: Leveraging CUDA for image processing can significantly speed up operations by utilizing the GPU. However, efficient memory management and kernel optimization are crucial to avoid bottlenecks.
- **Image processing Techniques**: Understanding and applying fundamental image processing techniques like blurring, edge detection, and color space conversion are essential for any computer vision task.
- **Software structure**: Organizing the project with a clear separation between headers, source files, and data allows for better maintainability and scalability. Using CMake simplifies the build process across different environments.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a comprehensive set of image processing techniques applied to both large and small datasets. The code is designed to be extensible, allowing for easy addition of new processing methods. The results clearly show the effectiveness of the algorithms implemented and provide a solid foundation for further exploration in image and video processing with CUDA.
